## Algorithms
  **Brute Force Backtracking**  
  Systematically enumerates over all possible tours. Backtracking when a knight runs out of valid moves

  **Warnsdorf's Rule**  
  Will move the knight so that it always proceeds to the square form which the knight will have the fewest onward moves. (Not including squares already visited.)

  **Divide and Conquer**  
  Divides the board into smaller pieces, constructing tours on each piece, and patching the pieces together.

  **Nueral Network Solution**  
  _Coming Soon!_
